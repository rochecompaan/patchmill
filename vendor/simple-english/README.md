Works in every harness that speaks the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io): Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI, Goose, OpenCode, and ~25 more. One folder, no dependencies, MIT.

## 📦 Install

```bash
npx skills add AminBlg/SimpleEnglish
```

That is it. The [skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) detects your agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Gemini CLI, and more) and installs for the ones you pick. Try before installing:

```bash
npx skills use AminBlg/SimpleEnglish@simple-english
```

**Claude Code plugin**: this repo is also a plugin marketplace. Run:

```
/plugin marketplace add AminBlg/SimpleEnglish
/plugin install simple-english@simple-english
```

**Output style** (Claude Code): the plugin also ships simple-english as an [output style](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/output-styles). The skill triggers when a writing task fits; the style is always on, for every reply. After you install the plugin, run `/config`, open **Output style**, and pick `simple-english`. Claude then writes all its prose in STE and codes as before.

No SKILL.md support at all? Paste [`prompts/system-prompt.md`](prompts/system-prompt.md) into your system prompt, AGENTS.md, or `.cursorrules`. There is even a ~60-token version for tight budgets.

Then ask for any technical writing, or say: *"rewrite this with simple-english"*.

## 🖱️ No terminal? (claude.ai, ChatGPT, Gemini)

**Claude.ai** (paid plans) supports skills natively:

1. Download the skill file: open [SKILL.md](https://github.com/AminBlg/SimpleEnglish/raw/main/skills/simple-english/SKILL.md) and save it (Ctrl+S / Cmd+S).
2. In claude.ai, go to **Settings → Capabilities** and turn on code execution.
3. Go to **Settings → Customize → Skills → Upload** and upload the saved `SKILL.md`.
4. Toggle the skill on. Done. Claude applies it when you ask for technical writing.

**ChatGPT**: no skill support, so use the prompt version. Copy the block from [`prompts/system-prompt.md`](prompts/system-prompt.md) into **Settings → Personalization → Custom Instructions**, or into the instructions of a Project or Custom GPT.

**Gemini**: create a Gem and paste the same block into its instructions.

**Any other chatbot**: attach or paste `prompts/system-prompt.md` into the chat and say "apply this to everything you write for me".

## 📏 The rules

53 numbered rules, 9 sections, written in 1983 by people whose readers die when a sentence is ambiguous. The ones doing the heavy lifting:

| Rule | What it kills 🪦 |
|---|---|
| Max 20 words per instruction, 25 per description | The run-on sentence |
| One word = one meaning, whole document | check/verify/confirm/validate roulette |
| Simple tenses only | "has been updated" → "we updated" |
| No "-ing" verb forms | ", making it easy to..." clauses |
| Active voice | "it should be noted that" |
| No should/would/may/might | Hedging. (`can`, `will`, `must` survive) |
| Condition BEFORE command | Trailing "...if the flag is set" that readers execute too late |
| One instruction per sentence | Steps nobody can follow at 2 a.m. |
| Keep articles, keep "that" | Telegraph style. STE is short, not terse |

Full paraphrased set with software examples: [`SKILL.md`](skills/simple-english/SKILL.md). Yes, this README breaks half of them. Marketing is explicitly out of STE scope. The skill knows that and stays in the docs. 😌

## 🧰 Not just docs

The skill ships adaptations ([`use-cases.md`](skills/simple-english/references/use-cases.md)) for:

- 🚨 **Error messages**: what happened → why → what to do, in that order
- 📟 **Runbooks**: STE's home turf; a runbook IS a maintenance manual
- 🧯 **Incident reports**: simple past murders "we have identified an issue that may have impacted"
- 📣 **Release notes**: breaking changes as warnings: command first, risk second
- 🤖 **Your AGENTS.md / prompts**: a system prompt is a procedure for a reader that cannot ask questions. Models read "should" as optional. STE bans "should". Think about it.
- 🌍 **Translation prep**: STE's original job: readable for non-natives, cheap to localize

Where it refuses to go: marketing copy, blog voice, brand writing. Flat on purpose. ✋

## 📊 Benchmarks

**72.9% fewer STE violations per 100 words with the skill on, averaged across 6 models × 8 writing tasks (96 generations, measured).**

| Model | Baseline viol/100w | Skill viol/100w | Reduction |
|---|---|---|---|
| claude-opus-4-8 | 1.05 | 0.62 | 41% |
| claude-opus-4-7 | 2.28 | 0.42 | 82% |
| claude-opus-4-6 | 2.24 | 0.40 | 82% |
| claude-opus-4-5 | 2.55 | 0.57 | 78% |
| claude-sonnet-5 | 2.67 | 0.53 | 80% |
| claude-sonnet-4-6 | 2.06 | 0.52 | 75% |

Output tokens went DOWN on all six Claude models too. Deterministic regex linter, same rules for both conditions, honest-caveat list and full method in [`evals/results/RESULTS.md`](evals/results/RESULTS.md). Reproduce with `python3 evals/run_bench.py` — needs only a logged-in Claude Code CLI.

### Pi cross-check

A separate Pi run tested four models on the same 8 tasks and 2 conditions. All 64 generations completed.

| Model | Baseline viol/100w | Skill viol/100w | Reduction |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| GLM-5.2 max | 2.56 | 0.40 | 84.4% |
| GPT-5.6 Sol medium | 1.33 | 0.16 | 88.0% |
| GPT-5.6 Terra medium | 1.69 | 0.48 | 71.6% |
| GPT-5.6 Luna medium | 1.28 | 0.42 | 67.2% |

The skill reduced measured violations on all four models. It shortened final text only on GLM-5.2; the three GPT-5.6 models wrote slightly more words.

See the [Pi results, method, raw responses, and reproduction command](evals/results/pi-2026-07-31/RESULTS.md). Run other configured models with `python3 evals/run_pi_bench.py --model PROVIDER/MODEL:THINKING`.

## 🧾 Receipts

Built TDD-style against the **primary Issue 9 text** (2025), not blog summaries:

- Baseline agents without the skill wrote 40-word sentences and **invented rule numbers**. One confidently cited "Rule 3.1: short sentences" (real Rule 3.1 is verb forms 💀)
- Secondary sources online are wrong about the modals: `can` and `will` ARE approved. We checked the PDF.
- The skill was written to close each recorded baseline failure, then re-tested until agents pass. Scenarios + recorded results: [`evals/pressure-tests.md`](evals/pressure-tests.md)
- A community audit ([#4](https://github.com/AminBlg/SimpleEnglish/issues/4)) checked the vocabulary tables against the Issue 9 dictionary and found the consistency pass offered "pick one" where the dictionary had already chosen. We fixed it, then A/B-tested the fix: two agents, same input, strict mode. The agent with the old skill picked the rejected verb "run". The agent with the fixed skill wrote operate, do, erase, show, and make sure that. Zero rejected words survived.

## ❓ FAQ

**Does this make output STE-certified?** No. Nothing does, because ASD certifies no tool. Default mode is pragmatic: structural rules + your domain vocabulary. Strict mode gets close; word-level rulings live in the official standard, a [free download](https://www.asd-ste100.org/request.html).

**Will my docs sound robotic?** They will sound like Airbus manuals: flat and impossible to misread. For docs that is the whole point. Keep your voice for your blog. ✍️

**Why not just prompt "write clearly"?** "Clearly" is an opinion. "No sentence over 20 words" is a spec. Agents follow specs. 📐

**Why a 40-year-old aerospace standard?** Because it is not vibes. It is maintained (Issue 9, January 2025), numbered, and testable. And it happens to be a near-perfect negative of every AI writing tell.
